I have some pretty strange criteria:  \n  \n- no database on the web ($$, configuation, etc...forget it)  \n- post content must support markdown (no HTML in database tables)   \n  \nThere seems to be one general way to handle this: local database, all posts in the database are pre-fetched and added to the React site somehow so they can be used to generate the \"posts\" page.  \n  \n### Pre-fetching?  \n  \nPre-fetching is key here. That's where the database is queried up front to collect data, and then the data is stored in the site code where JavaScript can see it and process it when the site renders.  \n  \nIf the posts are in a file in /public, they should be seen by the React code. I can then grab the file, read its contents, and loop through the items to build all of the posts. The react-markdown component appears to handle rendering just fine, so that leaves the actual pre-fetching.  \n  \nMariaDB supports rendering results as JSON. The mysql command line utility can connect to a remote database (it's inside my house, but not on the machine that's building/deploying the React site). Put the two together and you can query and render to JSON all on one command line.   \n  \n### What about security?  \n  \nWhat about it? I'm not sure security is much of an issue if there is no database being contacted, no comment forms to enter data, no DOS attack vectors that will drive up cloud database costs, etc. It's a static site with static data. I'm going to look into it, but I doubt I'll find anything that absolutely requires hand wringing.  \n  \n### SHIP IT  \n  \nWorking on it.
